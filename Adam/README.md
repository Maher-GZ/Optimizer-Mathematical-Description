# Adam Optimizer

## Overview
Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an optimization algorithm used for training machine learning models. It is an extension of stochastic gradient descent methods that computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. Adam combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely, AdaGrad and RMSProp.

## Features
- Adaptive learning rates: Adam computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter based on the first and second moments of the gradients.
- Momentum: Adam uses momentum to accelerate gradient descent in the relevant direction.
- Bias correction: Adam applies bias correction to the estimates of the first and second moments to account for their initialization bias.

## Usage
The Adam optimizer can be used in various machine learning and deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Here's a general guideline for using Adam optimizer:

1. Define your model architecture.
2. Choose suitable hyperparameters such as learning rate, beta1, beta2, and epsilon for the Adam optimizer.
3. Compile or instantiate your model with the Adam optimizer, specifying the chosen hyperparameters.
4. Train your model using the compiled model and your training data.
